# Onboarding of a CSIRT in a DDoS Data Mesh Network

Welcome to the GitHub repository containing the access control solution developed as part of the bachelor's thesis titled "Onboarding of a CSIRT in a DDoS Data Mesh Network". This project is at the heart of efforts to secure collaborative defense systems against DDoS attacks by enhancing a data mesh network's security.

This project builds upon existing work about data discovery in a DDoS data mesh network which can be accessed through this [repository](https://github.com/tportmann-uzh/ddos-data-mesh-network). The data mesh implemented in this work enables sharing DDoS fingerprints across domains, thereby facilitating a collective and resilient defense mechanism. The pivotal objective of this work is to implement an access control system that streamlines the onboarding process of new CSIRTs, by providing a solution to manage users permissions within the data mesh, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of the contained data.
